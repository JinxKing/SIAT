# SIAT
The SIAT has two part : Monitor and Analyzer. 

## Monitor

Monitor is based on the Android 4.3. In Android 4.3 system files, you should replace the the file [base] in path "\frameworks\base\" and file [io] in path  "/libcore/luni/src/main/java/java/io/".

You should generate the image and run it in the device or virtual device after replacing files.

Running the apps in new system "Monitor", you will get the running logs.
